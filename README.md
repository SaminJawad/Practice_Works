# Practice_Works ( C Programming )
Solutions of some problems as practice by C.

# Problems Covered

01.Write a program that takes two numbers as user input and calculates the sum of the numbers divisible by 5, 7, and 13 individually between those two input numbers. Do this using a while loop.<br/>

Sample Input:<>br/
10 50<br/>

Output:<br/>
Sum of numbers divisible by 5: 270<br/>
Sum of numbers divisible by 7: 189<br/>
Sum of numbers divisible by 13: 78<br/>

02.Write a program to print the ASCII values and their corresponding characters for all alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase letters). Do this using a for loop.

03.Write a program that takes four float numbers (a, b, c, d) as input and calculates the result of the following expression: (a^b / c)^d. Do this without using math.h library. Write the code using while loops.<be/>

Sample Input:<br/>
Enter the value of a: 2<br/>
Enter the value of b: 3<br/>
Enter the value of c: 4<br/>
Enter the value of d: 2<br/>

Output:<br/>
4.0

04.Write a program that takes a number to calculate its factorial and sums up all the even numbers between the input number and its factorial. Do this using for loops.<br/>

Sample Input:<br/>
Enter a number: 4<br/>

Output:<br/>
The factorial of 4 is: 24<br/>
The sum of even numbers between 4 and 24 is: 154<br/>

05.Write a program that takes an odd number N as input from keyboard and finds the value of the following series:<br/>
(3/2)^2 + (5/2)^2 + (7/2)^2 + ... + (N/2)^2<br/>

Sample Input:<br/>
Enter a number: 5<br/>

Output:<br/>
8.5
